What are the things required for hosting a website/webapp?
- We need a Web Server for hosting our website
- We/Client/Browser will use HTTP protocol to communicate with any website
  - Protocols are used for networking OR client/server communication
  - Examples on Protocols: FTP, SMTP/POP3, TCP/IP, ...
    TODO: Check OSI layers
- A website is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- A website will basically comprise of:
  - static content
  - dynamic content
- Some pages of our website will be static and some would be dynamic 
  - For ex: searching for a product on flipkart, the result we see is dynamic
  - In most cases data required to be presenting dynamically will come from a database
    - We need someone who can pull this data from db and present it dynamically to the client
      - We cannot use plain HTML/CSS/JS for this
      - We need to additionally use Java technology to achieve this
- Java is not the only technology for developing website dynamically
  - We can use .NET/C#, Python, Node.js, PHP, ...
- To sum up:
  - If we need to create a static page, we will just focus on HTML, CSS and JS*
    - * JS can be used to make a page dynamic, like for ex: displaying the Date on the screen
    - * But JS cannot be used for dynamically fetching the data from the Database on the
        server and displaying the data on the screen of the client
    - We need to use Java additionally for achieving 100% dynamism in our websites

- A website is made up of:
  - client side code
    - code which will run on the client's machine / browser
      - HTML/CSS/JS runs on the client side
      - Examples on client side JS libraries:
        - jQuery
        - Angular
        - React
  - server side code
    - code which will run on the server / web server
      - Java/Python/.NET
      - Can we use JavaScript on the server side also?
        - That means can we write server side code using JavaScript?
          - The answer is YES
            - We can use a server side framework called as Node.js

- Remember:
  - Everything is kept on the server
  	- The client side code as well the server side code both
  	- When we access any website, the client side code get's downloaded on our machine and get's executed with the help of the browser

- To learn Web development using Java
  - Prerequisite:
    - Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS
    - Basic knowledge of Java
  - Environment
    - For coding, we will use some IDE:
      - Eclipse
    - For running/hosting/deploying our application, we need a web server:
      - Tomcat

What is a Servlet?
- A servlet is a Java program which is executed using HTTP protocol
  and it's used for generating html pages dynamically

http://localhost:8181/MyWebApp/index.html
http://localhost:8181/MyWebApp/HelloServlet

Browser has no knowledge whether the url that we are accessing is static or dynamic

TODO:
- Read about HTTP protocol and it's methods (GET, POST, ..)
- What is the role of Web Server?
  - In the industry the most popular web servers are:
    - Nginx
    - Apache Web Server
    - Microsoft IIS
  - Then what is Apache Tomcat?
    - How is it different from Apache Web Server?
